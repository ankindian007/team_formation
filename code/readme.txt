HyperPrior.m is the Matlab source code of HyperPrior algorithm. You need Bioinformatics Toolbox and Optimization Toolbox of Matlab to run the program. example.m illustrates a simple example to call HyperPrior for semi-supervised learning in an artificial dataset. If you want to apply HyperPrior to large scale problems, please use ILOG CPLEX to replace the "quadprog" function in the code.
